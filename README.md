Hi :smile:

📚 I'm a senior at Tulane University in the combined degree program for Public Health (with a concentration in Epidemiology) ⚕️

Outside of school, I am a research assistant at the Louisiana Cancer Research Center 🔬 , play volleyball 🏐 , and love to cook 🥘

I'm looking forward to learning how to code this semester 👩‍💻 !
